"""
At a certain airport, 75% of the flights arrive on time. A sample of 10 flights is
studied.Hint: Estimate p. Then use a Binomial pmf or CDF function with parameters n=10
and p.
"""
# Setup

# a. Find the probability that all 10 of the flights were on time.

# b. Find the probability that exactly eight of the flights were on time.

# c. Find the probability that eight or more of the flights were on time.

"""
The number of cars arriving at a given intersection follows a Poisson distribution with
a mean rate of 4 per second.
"""
# Setup

# a. What is the probability that 3 cars arrive in a given second (i.e. 1 second
#    interval)? 

# b. What is the probability that 8 cars arrive in a period of three seconds?Hint: The
#    Poisson parameter will be different based on the time interval of interest. So, ùúÜin
#    1 second, 2ùúÜ in 2 seconds, etc.

# c. What is the probability that more than 3 cars arrive in a period of two
#    seconds?Hint: Use the fundamental rule that P(A)= 1 - P(A^c)

A chemist wishes to estimate the concentration of particles in a certain suspension. She
withdraws 3 mL of the suspension and counts 48 particles. 
"""
# Setup

# a. Estimate the concentration in particles per mL.  

# b. Find the uncertainty in the estimate.

# a. Search online for an example of a Poisson process and give the reference. (Hint:
#    Use Google Scholar or similar search tool for academic articles).

# b. Describe the experiment or process from your reference and explain what makes it a
#    Poisson process.

# c. Using the Poisson parameters given in the reference, pose your own question and
#    make an appropriate Poisson calculation.
