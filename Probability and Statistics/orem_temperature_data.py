# Data Collection 
# Google the average daily temperature for the last two years (or so) in Orem, UT. 
# Collect all data in a vector. This will serve as the population. 

# Preferably out put the data to a csv file
# That way it is easier to import as Pandas data frame. 

# First column: date 
# Second column: temperature
