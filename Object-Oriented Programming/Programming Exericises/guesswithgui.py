"""
Write a GUI-based program that plays a guess-the-number game in which the roles of the
computer and the user are the reverse of what they are in the Case Study of this
chapter. In this version of the game, the computer guesses a number between 1
(lowerBound) and 100 (upperBound) and the user provides the responses.

The window should display the computerâ€™s guesses with a label. The user enters a hint in
response, by selecting one of a set of command buttons labeled Too small, Too large, and
Correct. When the game is over, you should disable these buttons and wait for the user
to click New game, as before.
