      <h2>Final Project Documentation</h2>
      <h3>This game is optimized for Google Chrome.</h3>
      <p>This is a sudoku game that has the following features:</p>
      <h4>Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript</h4>
      <p>
        The sudoku board and number selection board html is generated by
        JavaScript. The functions createGameBoard and createGameSelectOptions
        creates the table elements and adds a css styling to it. The script uses
        document.createElement method to generate the html.
      </p>
      <h4>User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons</h4>
      <p>
        The number selection board lets users select which number they would
        like to place on the board. There are several buttons in the game like
        starting a new game or loading the last played puzzle.
      </p>
      <h4>User input in the form of mouse clicks</h4>
      <p>
        User uses mouse to play the game. The number selection and placing the
        selected number to the board listens for mouse click event.
      </p>
      <h4>Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions</h4>
      <p>
        Once the html loaded the game will create the sudoku board and number
        selection pad. Once the difficulty selected and new game button clicked,
        puzzle will be loaded to the sudoku board. When you click on a board
        cell, it will display the number selected. If it is wrong it will
        indicate the error by changing the style temporarily.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on
        the grid page
      </h4>
      <p>
        All the puzzles for this game loaded by XMLHttpRequest. The puzzles are
        stored in a json file called puzzles.json in data folder. You can see
        this in fetchPuzzles function.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage
      </h4>
      <p>
        When you select a difficulty and start a new game a random puzzle with
        that difficulty will be loaded. The game stores this puzzle to local
        storage. If you start a game using start new game with last puzzle. The
        script will fetch the last played puzzle and start a new game with it.
      </p>
      <h4>Game logic code</h4>
      <p>Sudoku puzzle's given numbers are styled bold.</p>
      <p>Given numbers also cannot be changed.</p>
      <p>There is a feedback for incorrect numbers. (Animation and chime)</p>
      <p>
        There are three difficulties (also additional debug difficulty for
        testing) The game will select a random puzzle for each difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>Puzzles are loaded using Ajax</p>
      <p>
        Once a new game started the timer will show how long the player working
        on the puzzle. Once the game ends the timer will stop.
      </p>
      <h4>Extra Credit Include a second HTML5 component.</h4>
      <p>
        I used audio for the extra credit. When user selects a wrong number for
        the sudoku cell, wrong selection audio will play. Also there is a
        different audio for correct numbers.
