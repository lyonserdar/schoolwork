  <h1>Assignment 1: Project Description and Game Grid</h1>
  <h2>Description Page</h2>
  <p>For this project I picked the Adventure/dungeon game map.</p>
  <p>The game terrain will have a tile map and the player will have a tile based
    movement using keyboard keys(W, A, S,
    D or arrow keys).</p>
  <p>The map will have border tiles that are impassable, and some other tiles like walls
    also impassable</p>
  <p>If the player get to the destination tile, the game will end. The destination tile
    will be protected by a locked
    gate.</p>
  <p>Player will have to obtained the key to unlocked the gate.</p>
  <p>The game will have a basic inventory to hold the key. And display it to the user
    once they obtain it.</p>
  <p>For this game I will use <a href="https://www.kenney.nl/assets/monochrome-rpg"
      target="_blank">these assets</a>
